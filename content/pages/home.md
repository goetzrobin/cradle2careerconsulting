        Each day, Dannie and Simone work small miracles with not just my children, but all the lucky children in their care. On Friday, they ascended to new heights by helping my daughter Ryan experience a musical theater performance where the singing, dancing, acting and production were executed at the highest levels. Ryan had the time of her life and came home all the more inspired to pursue her own passion for performing, knowing that Dannie and Simone have made a lifelong commitment to cheering her on and having her back as she strives toward each and every one of her dreams.

      intro: The most trustworthy babysitter, respected mentor and competent teacher and advocate both academically (French, Spanish, English, writing, reading and math) and social-emotionally
      name: Soumountha

        Simone has an invaluable place in our family that includes three young children as the most trustworthy babysitter, respected mentor and competent teacher and advocate both academically (French, Spanish, English, writing, reading and math) and social-emotionally. Not only are my children’s well-being and happiness her top priority but she has become a true partner for my husband and me with any issues related to their overall development.


        We value her expertise, intelligence and sound judgment to choose and coordinate activities during the school year and vacation breaks throughout New York’s 5 boroughs, New Jersey and Long Island, as well as to identify developmental and learning milestones that make sense for each child and address them with dedication and consistency. Simone has an exceptional understanding of children’s different needs, aspirations and aptitudes.

      intro: Simone has been invaluable in helping to steward my daughters in the direction I hope for them, in the direction that is best for them, and in the direction that allows them to meet their greatest potential and annihilate the odds against them as little women of color.

        Since meeting Simone in 2013, she has changed our lives for the better.  At the time, she was studying at Columbia University and intermittently babysitting for a close (Laotian) friend of mine in an effort to practice her French. I would occasionally encounter her at Soumountha’s kids’ birthday parties and play-dates and was immediately impressed by her acuity and engagement with regard to all things pediatric and her evident love for all the children she works with. My daughters came home from every occasion with her sporting new knowledge or heightened confidence and therefore, since they were toddlers, I knew I had to devise a plan for her to work with my girls in a formal, consistent capacity without stepping on Soumountha’s toes. Fortunately, in the Fall of 2017 Simone started Cradle to Career Consulting and thus endeavored to dedicate herself to supporting kids and families like mine full time. I jumped at the opportunity to sign my girls up to work with her regularly. She has served as a tutor, an advisor, a strategist, an organizer and a tremendous role model for my two daughters and our family would be lost without her.


        Simone has been invaluable in helping to steward my daughters in the direction I hope for them, in the direction that is best for them, and in the direction that allows them to meet their greatest potential and annihilate the odds against them as little women of color. Now, at ages 7 and 8, Gabriella and Lyla are both performing far above grade level in all academic arenas, their own senses of work ethic and personal motivation are beyond anything I could have imagined and Lyla’s self-esteem (which we’ve worried about) has skyrocketed because of the plans and goals we’ve set and successfully executed with Simone.


        Simone and I have discussed these goals and objectives I have for my girls and the tremendous potential we both see in Gabriella and Lyla at length on numerous occasions. It is a special thing to watch Simone light up and boil over with energy and eagerness during such conversations giving me all the hope I need to raise kids in the trying world we live in today. Simone’s passion and fire are something truly special. She brings the highest degrees of organization, work ethic, innovation, consistency, empathy, attention to detail and pure grit to everything she does for my kids and I cannot express how blessed we feel to have her!

      intro: She holds Sydney and Mckenna to high standards in all academic subjects, as well as in character and social-emotional aptitude, so that they can and will fulfill their greatest potential because Simone believes in my daughters as much as we do.

        Simone has stewarded our daughters’ Spanish accusation for several successful years. Currently, as 8 and 9-year-olds they comprehend Spanish fluently, read eloquently and their verbal expression improves daily. While in her care, Simone ensures that our daughters’ healthy development and happiness are her top priorities and aspires to those goals at the highest possible level. She holds Sydney and Mckenna to high standards in all academic subjects, as well as in character and social-emotional aptitude, so that they can and will fulfill their greatest potential because Simone believes in my daughters as much as we do. It is a true pleasure to work with someone who works as hard for my girls as I would myself and who also goes above and beyond to help keep us updated and organized regarding our daughters’ busy schedules so that we can reserve the precious family time we have for enjoying our kids rather than managing countless logistics.

  text: Hi! My name is Simone Henry and I am a lifelong child advocate and child
    development counselor. I started off as a preschool teacher's helper at the
    age of nine and have volunteered with children in every community I've been
    a part of since. I volunteered with and babysat/ advocated for countless NYC kids throughout my time studying at Columbia University (thus getting to know the city and the school systems) and then returned to graduate school to learn how to truly serve as a child advocate via Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. 
    Nothing brings me bigger, brighter and more profound joy
    than sitting down with a family or institution and strategizing with them on
    how to help their child or children be and stay as happy and as successful
    as possible. No matter the challenge, I will work tirelessly with you to
    reach your child's full potential and I hope our work brings you joy, hope,
    light and a lot less stress!
