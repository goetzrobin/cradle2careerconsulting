  text: Hi! My name is Simone Henry and I am a lifelong child advocate and child
    development counselor. I started off as a preschool teacher's helper at the
    age of nine and have volunteered with children in every community I've been
    a part of since. Nothing brings me bigger, brighter and more profound joy
    than sitting down with a family or institution and strategizing with them on
    how to help their child or children be and stay as happy and as successful
    as possible. No matter the challenge, I will work tirelessly with you to
    reach your child's full potential and I hope our work brings you joy, hope,
    light and a lot less stress!
